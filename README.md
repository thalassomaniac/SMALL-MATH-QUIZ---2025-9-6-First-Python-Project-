# SMALL-MATH-QUIZ---2025-9-6-First-Python-Project-
A fun and educational small project I created! This is the first one I document, so treat it warmly! This is written in python. 

WHAT THIS DO?: 
- It will ask several math questions and will go on by difficultly by grade. Sadly, it only goes up to 9th. After the quiz, it will tell you your score.

HOW DO I RUN THIS?:
- You can use Visual Studio Code! Copy and paste the code there, and make sure you have python installed in order for it to work.

WHY DID I MAKE THIS?:
- I have been fascinated by computer programming. So I wanted to document my passion and see how I progress!
